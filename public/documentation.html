        <h1>myMovies API Documentation</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>App Desription</h2>
        <p>The complete server-side of this web application will consist of a well-designed REST API and
        architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The REST API
        will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods
        (CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from your database and store that data in a non-relational
        way.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Whenever users of myMovies are interacting with the application, the server-side of the
        application will be in use, processing their requests and performing operations against the
        data in the database. These users will be able to use the myFlix application whenever they like
        to read information about different movies or update their user information, for instance, their
        list of “Favorite Movies.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Movie enthusiasts want to be able to access information about different movies,
        directors, and genres. The server-side of the myMovies application will ensure they have access
        to this information, that their requests can be processed, and that all necessary data can be
        stored.
